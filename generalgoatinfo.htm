<small>Summary of some general goat information we've come across & found interesting or helpful.</small><br>
<br><br>

<table width="600px">

<font size="3"><b>History</b></font>

<p>Goats seem to have been first domesticated roughly 10,000 years ago in
the Zagros Mountains of Iran. Ancient cultures and tribes began to
keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins. Domestic
goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other
grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were frequently children
or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These
methods of herding are still used today.</p>

<p>Historically, goat hide has been used for water and wine bottles in
both traveling and transporting wine for sale. It has also been used
to produce parchment, which was the most common material used for
writing in Europe until the invention of the printing press.</p>

   </tr>
   
   <tr>
	<td align="left">

<font size="3"><b>Anatomy</b></font>

<p>Goats are ruminants. They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of
the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum.</p>

<p>Goats have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, an adaptation which
increases peripheral depth perception. Because goats' irises are
usually pale, the pupils are much more visible than in animals with
horizontal pupils but very dark irises, such as sheep, cattle and most
horses.</p>

<p>Some breeds of sheep and goats appear superficially similar, but goat
tails are short and point up, whereas sheep tails hang down and are
usually longer (though some are short, and some long ones are docked).</p>

   <tr>
	<td align="left">

<font size="3"><b>Reproduction</b></font>

<p>In some climates, goats are able to breed at any time of the year. In
temperate climates and among the Swiss breeds, the breeding season
commences as the day length shortens, and ends in early spring. Does
of any breed come into heat every 21 days for 2 to 48 hours. A doe in
heat typically flags her tail often, stays near the buck if one is
present, becomes more vocal, and may also show a decrease in appetite
and milk production for the duration of the heat.</p>

<p>Bucks (intact males) of Swiss and northern breeds come into rut in the
fall as with the doe's heat cycles. Rut is characterized by a decrease
in appetite and obsessive interest in the does.</p>

<p>In addition to natural mating, artificial insemination has gained
popularity among goat breeders, as it allows easy access to a wide
variety of bloodlines.</p>

<p>Gestation length is approximately 150 days. Twins are the usual
result, with single and triplet births also common. Less frequent are
litters of quadruplet, quintuplet, and even sextuplet kids. Birthing,
known as kidding, generally occurs uneventfully. Right before kidding
the doe will have a sunken area around the tail and hip. Also she will
have heavy breathing, a worried look, become restless and show great
display of affection for her keeper. The mother often eats the
placenta, which gives her much needed nutrients, helps stanch her
bleeding, and is believed by some to reduce the lure of the birth
scent for predators.</p>

<p>Freshening (coming into milk production) occurs at kidding. Milk
production varies with the breed, age, quality, and diet of the doe;
dairy goats generally produce between 660 to 1,800 L (1,500 and 4,000
lb) of milk per 305 day lactation. On average, a good quality dairy
doe will give at least 6 lb (2.7 l) of milk per day while she is in
milk, although a first time milker may produce less, or as much as 16
lb (7.3 l) or more of milk in exceptional cases. Meat, fiber, and pet
breeds are not usually milked and simply produce enough for the kids
until weaning.</p>

<font size="3"><b>Diet</b></font>

<p>Goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything. The
digestive systems of a goat allow nearly any organic substance to be
broken down and used as nutrients. Contrary to this reputation, they
are quite fastidious in their habits, preferring to browse on the tips
of woody shrubs and trees, as well as the occasional broad leaved
plant. However, it can fairly be said that goats will eat almost
anything in the botanical world. Their plant diet is extremely varied
and includes some species which are toxic or detrimental to cattle and
sheep. This makes them valuable for controlling noxious weeds and
clearing brush and undergrowth. They will seldom eat soiled food or
contaminated water unless facing starvation. This is one of the
reasons why goat rearing is most often free ranging since stall-fed
goat rearing involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially
viable. Goats do not usually consume garbage, tin cans, or clothing,
although they will occasionally eat items made primarily of plant
material, which can include wood. They have an intensely inquisitive
and intelligent nature: they will explore anything new or unfamiliar
in their surroundings. They do so primarily with their prehensile
upper lip and tongue. This is why they investigate items such as
buttons, camera cases or clothing (and many other things besides) by
nibbling at them, occasionally even eating them.</p>

<p>The digestive physiology of a very young kid (like the young of other
ruminants) is essentially the same as that of a monogastric animal.
Milk digestion begins in the abomasum, the milk having bypassed the
rumen via closure of the reticular/esophageal groove during suckling.
At birth the rumen is undeveloped, but as the kid begins to consume
solid feed, the rumen soon increases in size and in its capacity to
absorb nutrients.</p>

<p>Goats will consume, on average, 4.5 units of dry matter per 100 units
of body-weight per day.</p>

<font size="3"><b>Goat Uses</b></font>

<p>A goat is useful to humans both alive and dead, first as a renewable
provider of milk and fibre, and then as meat and hide. Some charities
provide goats to impoverished people in poor countries, because goats
are easier and cheaper to manage than cattle, and have multiple uses.
In addition, goats are used for driving and packing purposes.</p>

<p>For instance, the intestine is used to make "catgut", which is still
in use as a material for internal human sutures. The horn of the goat,
which signifies wellbeing (Cornucopia) is also used to make spoons
etc.</p>

	<td align="left">

<font size="3"><b>Meat</b></font>

<p>The taste of goat meat is similar to that of lamb meat; in fact, in
some parts of Asia, particularly India, the word "mutton" is used to
describe both goat and lamb meat. However, some feel that it has a
similar taste to veal or venison, depending on the age and condition
of the goat. It can be prepared in a variety of ways including stewed,
curried, baked, grilled, barbecued, minced, canned, or made into
sausage. Goat jerky is also another popular variety.</p>

<p>Nutritionally, goat meat is healthier than mutton as it is lower in
fat and cholesterol, and comparable to chicken. It also has more
minerals than chicken, and is lower in total and saturated fats
than other meats. One reason for the leanness is that goats do not
accumulate fat deposits or "marbling" in their muscles; chevon (goat
meat) must ideally be cooked longer and at lower temperatures than
other red meats. It is popular in the Middle East, South Asia,
Africa, northeastern Brazil, the West Indies, and Belize. Chevon, as
yet, is not popular in most western nations, though it is among the
fastest growing sectors of the livestock industry in the US.</p>

<p>Other parts of the goat including organs are also equally edible.
Special delicacies include the brain (where legal) and liver. The head
and legs of the goat may be smoked and used to prepare unique spicy
dishes and soup.</p>

<p>One of the most popular goats grown for meat is the South African
Boer, introduced into the United States in the early 1990s. The New
Zealand Kiko is also considered a meat breed, as is the Myotonic or
"fainting goat", a breed originating in Tennessee.</p>

<font size="3"><b>Milk, Butter and Cheese</b></font>

<p>Some goats are bred for milk, which can be drunk fresh, although
pasteurization is recommended to reduce naturally occurring bacteria. 
Goat milk is commonly processed into cheese, and small commercial
operations offer goat butter and ice cream. If the strong-smelling
buck is not separated from the does, his scent will affect the milk.</p>

<p>Goat milk contains less lactose than cow's milk, so is less likely to
trigger lactose intolerance. The milk is naturally homogenized since
it lacks the protein agglutinin. The curd is much smaller. The milk
also has a more similar makeup (percentage of fats, etc.) to human
milk than cow's milk. For these reasons, goat milk may be recommended
for infants and people who have difficulty digesting cow's milk. On
the other hand the UK Department of Health says that "infant milks
based on goats' milk protein are not suitable as a source of nutrition
for infants (under 1 year of age)." They also state that "formula
derived from goats' milk is also unsuitable for babies who are lactose
intolerant as it contains similar levels of lactose to
cow's-milk-based infant formulae."</p>

<p>Goat butter is white (compared to yellow butter from cow's milk)
because the goats produce milk with the yellow beta-carotene converted
to a colorless form of vitamin A.</p>

<p>Goat cheese is known as chèvre in France, after the French word for
"goat". Some varieties include Rocamadour and Montrachet. Feta is a
well-known Greek variety that may be made with a blend of goat and
sheep milk.</p>

<font size="3"><b>Fiber</b></font>

<p>Some goats are bred for the fiber from their coats. Most goats have
softer insulating hairs nearer the skin, and longer guard hairs on the
surface. The desirable fiber for the textile industry is the former,
and it goes by several names (mohair, fleece, goat wool, cashmere,
etc., explained below). The coarse guard hairs are worthless as they
cannot be spun or dyed. The proportion and texture varies between
breeds, and has been a target of selective breeding for millennia.</p>

<p>The Cashmere goat produces a fiber, cashmere wool, which is one of the
best in the world. It is very fine and soft. Most goats produce
cashmere fiber to some degree, however the Cashmere goat has been
specially bred to produce a much higher amount of it with fewer guard
hairs.</p>

<p>The Angora breed produces long, curling, lustrous locks of mohair. The
entire body of the goat is covered with mohair and there are no guard
hairs. The locks constantly grow and can be four inches or more in
length.</p>

<p>Goats do not have to be slaughtered to harvest the wool, which is
instead sheared (cut from the body) in the case of Angora goats, or
combed, in the case of Cashmere goats. However, the Angora goat
usually gets shorn twice a year with an average yield of about 10
pounds while the Cashmere goat grows its fiber once a year and it
takes about a week to comb out by hand, yielding only about 4 ounces.</p>

<p>The fiber is made into products such as sweaters and doll's hair. Both
cashmere and mohair are warmer per ounce than wool and are not
scratchy or itchy or as allergenic as wool sometimes is. Both fibers
command a higher price than wool, compensating for the fact that there
is less fiber per goat than there would be wool per sheep.</p>

<p>In South Asia, cashmere is called "pashmina" (from Persian pashmina,
"fine wool") and these goats are called pashmina goats (these
well-fleeced animals are often mistaken for sheep). Since these goats
actually belong to the upper Kashmir and Laddakh region, their wool
came to be known as "cashmere" in the West. The pashmina shawls of
Kashmir, with their intricate embroidery, are very famous.</p>

<font size="3"><b>Showing</b></font>

<p>Goat breeders' clubs frequently hold shows, where goats are judged on
traits relating to conformation, udder quality, evidence of high
production, longevity, build and muscling (meat goats and pet goats)
and fiber production and the fiber itself (fiber goats). People who
show their goats usually keep registered stock and the offspring of
award-winning animals command a higher price. Registered goats, in
general, are usually higher-priced if for no other reason than that
records have been kept proving their ancestry and the production and
other data of their sires, dams, and other ancestors. A registered doe
is usually less of a gamble than buying a doe at random (as at an
auction or sale barn) because of these records and the reputation of
the breeder. Children's clubs such as 4-H also allow goats to be
shown. Children's shows often include a showmanship class, where the
cleanliness and presentation of both the animal and the exhibitor as
well as the handler's ability and skill in handling the goat are
scored. In a showmanship class, conformation is irrelevant since this
is not what is being judged.</p>

<p>Various "Dairy Goat Scorecards" (milking does) are systems used for
judging shows in the US. The American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA)
scorecard for an adult doe includes a point system of a hundred total
with major factors including general appearance, the dairy character
of a doe (physical traits that aid and increase milk production), body
capacity, and specifically for the mammary system. Young stock and
bucks are judged by different scorecards which place more emphasis on
the other three categories; general appearance, body capacity, and
dairy character</p>
