<p align="justify">In nature, the Great Pyrenees is confident, gentle,
and affectionate. While territorial and protective of his flock or
family when necessary, his general demeanor is one of composure, both
patient and tolerant. He is strong willed, independent and reserved,
yet attentive, fearless and loyal to his charges both human and
animal.<br> <br> Elegant and eye-catching, the Great Pyrenees is a
great guard dog, who also happens to be nocturnal by nature.  In the
Pyrenean Mountains their task was to protect the flocks against
predators. Such as wolves and bears, also two legged human "predators"
were not unknown.<br> <br> The Great Pyrenees is a capable and
imposing guardian, devoted to its family, and somewhat wary of
strangers - human or canine. They are often used to guard livestock.
When not provoked, it is calm, well- mannered, and somewhat serious.
Courageous, very loyal and obedient. Gentle and affectionate with
those he loves. Devoted to family even if self-sacrifice is required.
It is very gentle with its family and children.  It has an independent
nature, and may try to dominate a less secure or meek owner.  A
serious worker, but very independent. The Great Pyrenees is good with
non-canine animals, and usually loves cats. These dogs do not reach
maturity until they are about 2 years old.<br> <br> The Pyrenees is a
relative of the St. Bernard, contributing to their development. It has
a long history as a guard dog of sheep. The dogs made their way to
Europe, the Great Pyrenees remained in the high mountain regions until
the Middle ages, When the breed gradually gained popularity with the
French nobility as a guard dog. By the late 17th century, every French
noble wanted to own one.  The Great Pyrenees was the most favorite
breed for the aristocratic owners of the large estates and Castles in
France. Where they were used as company dogs and as guarding dogs.<br>
<br> Armed with a spiky collar and thick coat, the Great Pyrenees
protected vulnerable flocks from such predators as wolves and bear.
The Great Pyrenees has proven to be a very versatile breed working as
an avalanche rescue dog, as a cart-puller, sled dog, as a pack dog on
ski trips, a flock guardian, dog of war, and as a companion and
defender of family and property. The AKC officially recognized the
Great Pyrenees in 1933.</p>
